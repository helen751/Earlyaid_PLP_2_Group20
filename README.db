# *********************EarlyAid Database Project****************

This README.db file is a guide on how to use the .sql file that will be use by all group members to add and modify various tet data. 


Basically; the EarlyAid project is designed to support user data, children profiles, doctors, questions, risks, suggestions, and responses.

The - `earlyaid_schema.sql` â€” SQL script has the basic strucutre  that will be manipulated and be used to to create the database and all tables.

**********************************************************************************************************

### Prerequisites

- Access to a MySQL server (e.g., your Aiven MySQL) using your Credentials (host, port, username, password) for your MySQL database
No need to stres with pycharm if its confusing. U can connect to the erver using VScode apk. ALL works just the same
---

### Setup of the Database   OPTION 101

Step1. **Create the database and tables**

This will be done by Running the the schema SQL script using the MySQL client:   U can use the skeleton code below 

```bash
mysql -h <your_host> -P <your_port> -u <your_username> -p < earlyaid_schema.sql


U will have to Replace <your_host>, <your_port>, and <your_username> with your actual MySQL connection details.

Enter your password when prompted; Verify tables; After running the script, connect to your database and run:

To verify ; run the command below:::::::::::::::
SHOW TABLES;

You should see the list of tables created.



Using Python to Connect to the MySQL Database --------->>> OPTION 202 <..>
You can connect your Python application to the earlyaid_db MySQL database to run queries, insert data, or build full applications 

Step1. Install the MySQL Connector
Make sure the mysql-connector-python library is installed using the command below:
pip install mysql-connector-python

Step2. Sample Python Script for Connecting
Here's a basic example that connects to the database and prints all doctors:

python
import mysql.connector

# Replace with your actual Aiven or MySQL server credentials
db_config = {
    'host': 'your-host.aivencloud.com',
    'port': 12345,
    'user': 'your-username',
    'password': 'your-password',
    'database': 'earlyaid_db'
}

try:
    conn = mysql.connector.connect(**db_config)
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM doctors;")
    results = cursor.fetchall()

    for row in results:
        print(row)

except mysql.connector.Error as err:
    print(f"Error: {err}")
finally:
    if conn.is_connected():
        cursor.close()
        conn.close()



Step3. Inserting Data Example

python
cursor.execute("""
    INSERT INTO doctors (name, contact) 
    VALUES (%s, %s)
""", ('Dr. Amina', 'amina@example.com'))
conn.commit()
